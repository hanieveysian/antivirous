main.c is the code you have to run.
First it wellcomes you to my antivirous and gives you 3 choices and runs over and over them until you press EXIT option's number.

The first option is phase1:
When you choose phase1 program runs the phase1 funtion which is in the phase1.c that is included in main.c.
Phase1 first asks you for a directory.
You should enter a full directory name.
Then it asks you of a text file name(the textfile name has to include the whole address and the name together).
This text file name contains md5 hashes that you consider as malware or dangerous. 
So you can imagin what the first phase would do.
It would consider the files that have the same hash as one of the hashes in the text file, as malware.
It gives you two options for deleting.
One to delete all an two to delete one by one.
The first option would delete all the malware files and the second shows you the name of the file and the option for you to delete it or not.
Thats all!!!! 

Then we return to main.c menu.this time we choose phase2:
In phase2 again you need to enter the whole name of your chosen directory.
Then it askes you of a dll name (google it).
It will find all the exe files that use that specific dll and shows all the dll names of malware files and their names.
Deleting option is the same as phase1.


One problem -> My program shows only the files in that directory (there shouldnt be a directory in directory).So that directory must nooooot have any folders in it.
